# Activity Tracking Module (elatio)

This module provides **comprehensive tracking of user activity**, spanning both **online** (browser, OS-level) and **offline** logs, with an eye toward **large-scale data** use cases (e.g., health records, wearable integrations). The system is built to remain **privacy-first**, storing and processing data **locally** and only sharing insights or model updates when the user explicitly opts in.

## Features

- **Online Activity Tracking**  
  - Browser extension captures URLs, clicks, scrolling, and other web interactions in real-time.  
  - OS-level hooks record application focus time, window titles, file interactions, etc.

- **Offline & Manual Logging**  
  - Users can log offline activities (gym, reading, errands), either manually or via wearable integrations.  
  - Integrated with the same local encryption pipeline as online data.

- **Scalable Local Database**  
  - Designed with **partitioning** (e.g., by data type or time period) for performance.  
  - Capable of storing **large data volumes** (e.g., multi-year logs, health records, IoT data).

- **Goal Tracking & Basic Scoring**  
  - Define personal goals (e.g., “Limit social media to 1 hour/day,” “Run 5K daily”).  
  - Automatically computes daily/weekly “progress” or “efficiency” scores.

- **Federated Learning-Ready**  
  - Data stays local by default.  
  - Optional framework for on-device model training and secure sharing of **model updates** (differential privacy, secure enclaves, etc.).

- **Privacy & Encryption**  
  - End-to-end encryption of user data (e.g., SQLCipher, Rust-based libraries).  
  - Users have fine-grained controls over what data to retain, share, or monetize.

```

1. **Data Ingestion & Encryption**  
   - Collects data from browser extension, OS hooks, wearables, and health record imports.  
   - Immediately encrypts and stores data locally, preserving privacy.

2. **Scalable Encrypted Database**  
   - Uses a partitioned schema for different data domains (e.g., browsing vs. health).  
   - Offers robust indexing to handle large data sets efficiently.

3. **Local Analytics & Aggregation**  
   - Calculates daily usage, session groupings, and goal progress.  
   - Maintains caches/snapshots to keep queries fast.

4. **Federated Learning**  
   - Optional module for training ML models locally.  
   - Only model parameters or gradients are shared—raw data never leaves the user’s device.

5. **User Interface**  
   - Displays combined (online + offline) timelines, goals, scores, advanced charts, and potential data-sharing options.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/activity-tracker.git
   cd activity-tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - **Desktop App**:  
     ```bash
     cd desktop
     cargo build     # For Rust-based
     # or
     npm install && npm run build  # If Node-based UI
     ```
   
   - **Browser Extension**:  
     ```bash
     cd extension
     npm install
     npm run build
     ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   - Edit `.env` or environment variables for encryption keys (e.g., `ACTIVITY_TRACKER_KEY`), DB paths, etc.  
   - If health integrations are planned, set up OAuth tokens or local auth as needed.

4. **Run in Development Mode**

   - **Desktop**:  
     ```bash
     cargo run    # Rust
     # or
     npm run dev  # Node
     ```
   - **Browser Extension**:  
     - Load the `build/` or `dist/` folder in your browser (Developer Mode).

---

## Usage

1. **Start the Desktop App**  
   - Launch the main application to initialize the encrypted local DB and listener for incoming events.

2. **Enable the Browser Extension**  
   - As you browse, the extension intercepts and batches usage data (URLs, scroll, etc.) to the desktop app.

3. **OS-Level Activity & Offline Logging**  
   - The desktop app monitors active windows, while you can also manually log offline activities (gym, reading, etc.) via the UI or a future mobile app.

4. **Health & Wearable Data (Optional)**  
   - Integrate with Apple Health, Google Fit, etc., to unify fitness or medical metrics in the same local DB.  
   - You decide which metrics are stored, ensuring privacy.

5. **Analytics & Goal Tracking**  
   - View daily/weekly summaries, set goals (e.g., “2 hours coding,” “5K run”), and track progress.  
   - Data is partitioned by type (core usage, health, etc.) but displayed in one unified dashboard.

---

## Database Design & Future Integrations

- **Partitioned Schema**  
  - Keep large data sets (e.g., multi-year health records, extensive sensor logs) in separate partitions or attached databases.  
  - Improves performance and simplifies data retention policies.

- **Versioning & Snapshots**  
  - The system can maintain version histories for regulated data (HIPAA compliance, etc.).  
  - Allows rollbacks or audits without duplicating the entire database.

- **Indexing & Query Performance**  
  - Use time-series indexing for continuous sensor data.  
  - Optionally store text embeddings (vector indices) if using NLP-based searching or advanced analytics.

---

## Federated Learning & Data Monetization

- **Federated Learning**  
  - Implement local ML training (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Rust-based libs).  
  - Send only model updates (gradients) to a central aggregator or peer network.  
  - Protect user privacy via **differential privacy** or **secure enclaves**.

- **Data Monetization (Optional)**  
  - Users can opt to sell anonymized or aggregated data segments on a marketplace.  
  - Access controls let the user decide exactly what slices of data to share or withhold.

---

## Configuration & Privacy

1. **Encryption**  
   - By default, uses **SQLCipher** or a similar library for database-level encryption.  
   - Keys are stored locally (e.g., OS keychain/credential manager) and never leave the device.

2. **Privacy Controls**  
   - Toggle data collection on/off, exclude certain apps or websites, or set domain-level blacklists.  
   - Manage how and if any data is exported or shared (e.g., for federated learning or monetization).

3. **Compliance & Sensitivity**  
   - Potential support for HIPAA/CCPA/GDPR if users store health or personal data.  
   - All logging is user-controlled; data can be deleted or purged at the user’s request.

---

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Activity & Browser Tracking**  
   - Partitioned DB, local encryption, basic OS hooks, offline logging.

2. **Phase 2: Health Record Integrations**  
   - Adapters for Apple Health, Google Fit, possible manual import of medical PDFs or lab results.

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Indexing & Analytics**  
   - Time-series indexing, vector search, robust dashboards for large-scale data.

4. **Phase 4: Federated Learning**  
   - Local model training, differential privacy, secure enclaves for sensitive data.

5. **Phase 5: Marketplace & Monetization**  
   - An optional marketplace for aggregated or anonymized user data.  
   - Smart contracts or centralized escrow for transactions, respecting user sovereignty.
